# Introduction
Online company for various fields now has high margins due to its more transparent and complex nature. Several data holder’s data can be shared with 3rd party vendors when conducting online business, and those 3rd party vendors can then share it with end users through those data vendors. If the data owner wishes to sell any digital content over online sources when processing these things, it is presently very difficult to keep track of data protection, privacy, and honesty while doing it. In this online data base performs the revocation and registration process. First user should register with raw data. The raw data will be authenticated using authenticated data encryption technique. Next this encrypted data will be processed using data processing. Pseudo identity generation will provide the password for driver authentication. After data is encrypted it is verified. This verified based on two batches. First batch will be used for verification and second batch will collect the encrypted data. At last online data will be se cured very effectively.
# Research
- Effeciency and privacy preservation
  - The author intends to protect personal data from organization’s while preserving the framework's functionality. To create proposals, the framework proposes encoding confidential data and ability to handle it under encryption. The whole job paves the way for confidential recommendations to be generated in a secure manner.
- Account Trade
  - The set of responsible agreements for largescale data exchange between dishonest buyers. Framework agreements achieve accounting power and accountability toward unreliable consumers who can create mischief during dataset transfers to stabilize the massive information sharing situation. Similarly, only some conscientious sharing agreements to encourage information representatives to warn the dishonest customer whenever the fraudulent behavior is detected.
  - A structured validation tool to properly characterizes, explain, and measure the obligation of framework conventions, much like it does in real-world datasets. Some of the
difficulties make it unimportant to configuration account trade. The distinction between legal and illegal transactions is difficult to describe straight away. 
  - This is primarily due to the fact that fraudulent vendors may introduce additional irritation into others' datasets before achieving to exchanged them, and determining how much information should be irritated in order to be free of the first one isn't even in the software engineering space. This will allow efficient security models, for example k-secrecy and assorted variety, to be used while reducing the loss of data caused by the existing procedure. The primary class is based on a rugged nearest neighbor relationship. 
# Cost and Features
## Cost
It is free of cost. Since the system uses open source software.
## Features
It shows the result analysis of number of files processed using proposed system. In this, time to securing data in milli seconds and time required to regenerate original 
data in seconds are given in detail manner.
# Defining the System
The proposed system includes, which proficiently coordinates integrity and privacy safeguarding in data centers that are accessible through large servers.
# SWOT Analysis:

# 4W's and 1'H
## Who:
This is a helping hand for data markets for checking the integrity of data.
## What:
An integrity and privacy checker for checking the accuracy of the data’s collection while maintaining privacy. Data users can 
check the validity of data contributor’s identity as well as the stuff of raw data by ensuring the integrity of collection of data, while privacy protection prevents people from finding out these confidential contents.
## When:
There is a critical safety concern in a data market platforms, that's tricky to be certain the accuracy of data collection and processing, particularly when the data contributors’ privacy must be protected.
## Where:
Can be used in the data markets and many online information platforms. 
## How:
The user should register with raw data and the raw data will be encrypted. After data is encrypted it is verified based on two batches. First batch will be used for verification and second batch will collect the encrypted data.
