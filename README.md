# Introduction
Online company for various fields now has high margins due to its more transparent and complex nature. Several data holderâ€™s data can be shared with 3rd party vendors when conducting online business, and those 3rd party vendors can then share it with end users through those data vendors. If the data owner wishes to sell any digital content over online sources when processing these things, it is presently very difficult to keep track of data protection, privacy, and honesty while doing it. In this online data base performs the revocation and registration process. First user should register with raw data. The raw data will be authenticated using authenticated data encryption technique. Next this encrypted data will be processed using data processing. Pseudo identity generation will provide the password for driver authentication. After data is encrypted it is verified. This verified based on two batches. First batch will be used for verification and second batch will collect the encrypted data. At last online data will be se cured very effectively.
